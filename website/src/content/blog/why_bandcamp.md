Last year I quit Spotify. I had been using Spotify off and on since it first
launched in the USA in 2011. In the beginning it was a somewhat reasonable way
to find and listen to music, comparable to listening to the radio. I mostly used
it to play EDM kinds of music with minimal vocals as inspiring background noise
while working at the computer.

As time went on I grew more and more annoyed at the way music discovery worked
there. Everything was about playlists and algorithmic recommendations. There was
a lot of music to discover but it seemed like every "recommendation" was tainted
with ulterior motives that I didn't fully understand. It felt like what I
imagined the old payola radio days were like [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payola).

Spotify did help me discover vaporwave. So that is something I guess. But I'm
not sure if it was possible to miss the trend in the 2015 era.

The real reason I quit was that I started to get the feeling that my own musical
tastes were being strip mined. All the meaning and authenticity was being
drained out of music and being replaced by... something. I didn't fully
understand what was happening but I didn't ignore the feeling. Later I learned
the truth; Spotify was directly stuffing popular playlists with "ghost artists"
who made tracks as works-for-hire [[2]](https://harpers.org/archive/2025/01/the-ghosts-in-the-machine-liz-pelly-spotify-musicians/).

After I quit Spotify it got even worse. Amazingly, Spotify doesn't pay most
artists anything
[[3]](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/a-complete-guide-to-quitting-spotify?ref=aftermath.site).
This is because 81% of musicians don't have more than 1000 streams and Spotify
only pays out if you cross that threshold. Then I learned that the founder
directly supports AI powered flying death machines which is not something I
choose to support [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsing_(company)).

My solution these days is [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/). The company is not
perfect but you can at least find artists, pay for their music, then download
the tracks to your computer to play them. Kind of like how music used to be
before streaming.

On Bandcamp I have found lots of good artists. Some have been making music since
before I was born. Others just released their first track. The main thing I look
for in music is a deep undercurrent of meaning and the communication of an
authentic human experience. Luckily I find it in droves just waiting to be
discovered.
